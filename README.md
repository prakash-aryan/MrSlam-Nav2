This project is a mixed reality simulation of SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) and NAV2 (Navigation 2) using the Turtlebot3 robot in a real laboratory environment. The simulation runs on the Meta Quest 3 mixed reality headset, providing an immersive experience for exploring the capabilities of SLAM and NAV2 in a controlled mixed reality setting.

## Overview

The main components of this project are:

- [Turtlebot3](https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3): A simulated version of the Turtlebot3 robot, a small, affordable, and programmable robot widely used for education and research purposes. The Turtlebot3 is equipped with sensors and actuators that enable it to navigate and interact with its environment.
- [Unity Robotics Hub](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/Unity-Robotics-Hub): Used as a reference for setting up ROS (Robot Operating System) and robotics communication within the Unity environment. The Unity Robotics Hub provides tools, tutorials, and examples that facilitate the integration of ROS with Unity, enabling seamless communication between the simulated robot and the mixed reality environment.
- [OpenXR SDK](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/OpenXR-SDK) and [Unity XR Oculus](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/com.unity.xr.oculus.html): Used for building the project for the Meta Quest 3 mixed reality headset. These SDKs provide the necessary tools and libraries for developing MR applications that are compatible with the Meta Quest 3 and other OpenXR-compliant devices.

## Unity Version

This project was developed using [Unity 2021 LTS](https://blog.unity.com/engine-platform/introducing-unity-2021-lts), which offers long-term support and stability for the project. Unity 2021 LTS provides a reliable and performance-optimized platform for developing mixed reality applications, ensuring a smooth and immersive experience for the user.

## Project Status

Please note that this project is still under active development, and the code is not currently available for public access. The purpose of this README.md file is to provide an overview of the project, its components, and its goals. As the project progresses and reaches a stable state, more information and resources will be made available to the community.

## Simulated Video
